Time complexity

Notation meaning - a series or system of symbols used to represent numbers,amount, pr elements in something such as music or maths
Big o notation is used to describe performance of a algorithm
-to find given alg is scalable or not
-is this algo scale well as input grows
-alg is runing fast in our laptops donot mean it perform well when we give a large data set
-Big o notation symbol is O(n)


what  is use of data structure?
-certain operations can more or less costly depends on what data structure we use
-for example
-accessing a array elements by using index is super fast
-but array is fixed sized if you want to constantly add ot remove items from them they have to get resized this will become costly as input grow very large
-linked list grow and srink very quickly(resize) but accesing through index is too slow

space complexity

-nwe donot consider input size as O(n) in space complexity
-we just consider extra space requeid for an alg
